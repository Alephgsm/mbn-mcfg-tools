For older devices (Nexus 5X, 6P, or Pixel 1) the MBN files can be found in the baseband (radio) image that is located in the outer directory of the image

For newer devices (Pixel 2 to Pixel 5) the MBN files are placed within the vendor.img file; sometimes the vendor.img file has to be unpacked using simg2img

Pixel 6 onwards is no longer using a Snapdragon processor or Qualcomm modem, since they switched to their own Tensor units and cooperate with Samsung for the modem part
